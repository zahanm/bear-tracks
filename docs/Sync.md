# Sync FAQs

## Title

I expect that your note starts with

```
# Title Here
```

and give it the name `Title Here`.

## Conflicts

I check when the notes were last exported, and if the note
being imported has been modified in Bear.app after that,
I treat it as a conflict.

That means that I import it as a new note.
